# Phone-Mockup-Scroll

This project demonstrates how to create a scrolling effect for an image inside a phone mockup using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This repository contains the code to create a scrolling effect where an image inside a phone mockup scrolls vertically. The scrolling effect is achieved using JavaScript to simulate scrolling behavior and adjusting the background position accordingly.

## Features

- Simulated scrolling effect for an image inside a phone mockup.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SpyrosLefkaditis/Phone-Mockup-Scroll.git
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Scroll through the content inside the phone mockup to see the scrolling effect.

## Customization

- Adjust the width and height of the phone wrapper in the CSS file (`style.css`) to fit different phone mockup sizes.
- Replace the placeholder images (`phone-mockup.png` and `large-vertical-image.jpg`) with your own images.
